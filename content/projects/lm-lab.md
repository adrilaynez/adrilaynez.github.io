## LM-Lab: Interactive Language Model Exploration

LM-Lab is an interactive laboratory for exploring and experimenting with language models. This application provides a hands-on interface to understand how modern language models process and generate text, visualize attention patterns, and analyze model behavior in real-time.

### Features

- **Real-time Model Interactions**: Test different language models directly in the browser
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust model parameters to see how they affect outputs
- **Attention Visualization**: Understand how models focus on different tokens
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor inference time and resource utilization
- **Model Information**: View vocabulary sizes and parameter counts
- **Training Data Statistics**: Analyze the data used to train models
