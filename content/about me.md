## The Mission
I am a double-degree student in **Mathematics and Computer Science**, currently strictly focused on **Systems Engineering** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** for AI.

My philosophy is simple: **"Don't just import it. Build it."**

While the industry rushes to use the latest frameworks, I am taking a step back to understand the machinery. I am building deep learning engines from scratch—starting with Python, moving to C++, and optimizing with CUDA kernels—to bridge the gap between abstract mathematics and bare-metal performance.

## The Roadmap: "The Math-CS Engineer"
I am currently executing a rigorous engineering roadmap (2026) to master the full stack of Large Language Models:

1.  **Titan Engine (C++/CUDA):** My flagship project. A custom inference engine built from zero, implementing manual memory management, matrix multiplication kernels, and FlashAttention.
2.  **Visualizing the Black Box:** Building tools (like Attention & Sampling Visualizers) to make internal model states intuitive and debuggable.
3.  **Demystifying AI:** Writing accessible content to explain the mathematical foundations of AI (from Newton to Transformers) to a general audience.

## Technical Arsenal
* **Core:** C++, CUDA, Python, NumPy.
* **Theory:** Linear Algebra, Calculus, Complexity Analysis.
* **Tools:** Nsight Systems, Git, Hugo.
